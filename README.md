# Prismo-Client
Prismo-Client is a .NET application designed to randomize item and NPC locations within the PC version of Adventure Time: Secret of the Nameless Kingdom. This program serves the purpose of streamlining the use of the scripts from the [AT3-Randomizer project](https://github.com/colinthomas5/AT3-Randomizer).

The web application-version of Prismo by Suprnova may be found at https://www.prismo.at/ or at its [GitHub page](https://github.com/suprnova/Prismo).

## Prerequisites
As the program utilizes the scripts from the [AT3-Randomizer project](https://github.com/colinthomas5/AT3-Randomizer), it is required to have Python3 installed so that the scripts run successfully.

## Getting Started
Prismo does overwrite the files within the selected data folder, therefore it is strongly recommended to backup your vanilla data folder from your SOTNK installation. Alternatively, you may clone your SOTNK installation to maintain a vanilla copy. This is so you may return to a vanilla state for play or a new randomization at any point.

## Randomization
Prismo features may options for randomization preferences:
```
• Item randomization may be toggled on or off
• NPC randomization may be toggled on or off
• Item logic may be no logic or a basic logic which ensures that key items are not required to get themselves
• Item pool may be the standard pool or an expanded pool that adds in normally not-randomized items into the pool
• NPC pool may be the standard pool or Guntsanity, which replaces every NPC with Gunter (wenk)
```
